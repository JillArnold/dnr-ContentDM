ContentDM templates used for seekingmichigan.org
================================================

This project makes publicly available the custom templates developed for 
seekingmichigan.org.  The templates are for the advanced search form, 
the search results page, and everything related to viewing items.  You 
are free to use this code to aid in developing similar features.  However, 
the artwork and styles developed by Airbag Industries are copyrighted 
and cannot be used without permission.


About the Code
--------------

This is spaghetti code at its finest.  In the name of expediency, I 
simply updated the default ContentDM templates to match our custom 
layout and I tried to use as much of their existing code as possible.
As a result, the code is very hard to follow and I wouldn't recommend 
duplicating the effort.  I started to move in the right direction by 
building the Search class that actually has some unit tests written 
for it.  

One suggestion might be to use Ohio University's object-oriented 
ContentDM library, but it seemed a bit unwieldy at the time.
